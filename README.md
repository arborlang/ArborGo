# The Arbor programming language (Now in Go!)

Arbor is meant to be a pure functional language.

This is a language created for me, and anyone else, to play with [web assembly](http://webassembly.org/) or language construction. This compiler is written in go.

Arbor was first described in my blog post: [Completely Useless Fun Project: Building A New Programming Language](http://yoseph.tech/completely-useless-fun-project-build-a-new-programming-language/). I like challenges and I think this would be a fun one!

If you would like to contribute, I will make a list of issues, you can pick one and work on it. First I need to implement a test suite though, so I would give it a bit.

See the original arbor implementation [here](https://github.com/radding/Arbor).

## Specification

See the [specification docs](docs/spec/spec.md)

## Motivation

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯` Building languages are fun

## Contributing

Not much here yet. I will think about contribution guidelines and add more later. For now, just open an issue :)
