/*Package ast defines the things needed for taking an Arbor lexical token stream and writing out
the Arbor's IR, whether that is an LLVM instruction set or some other IR that I decide on. This
includes the type definitions for the Nodes, and functions, the nodes themselves. The AST is
generated int the `parser` package.
