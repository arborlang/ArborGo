### Building Arbor

To build Arbor, we have a make file, just run `make`. To make in debug mode, (which adds a couple of features and maybe better logs), run it as `make debug`. To run the tests, `make test`. `make` will output the binary to your local directory and call it `arbor`. Run `./arbor --help` to see help. Send me an [email](mailto:yoseph@shuttl.io), or [keybase](https://keybase.io/yosephr94) if you have questions.
